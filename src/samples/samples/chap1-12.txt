Here's a list of the five companies that I believe will be most affected by the new regulations.

These companies have made commitments to invest and grow locally for a long time. That commitment isn't cheap, and the impact of a reduction in capital investment would be very felt. These firms are also among the biggest players in the technology sector, so their impact will reverberate throughout the industry.

Some of these companies will probably be able to survive the new rules. Others will probably want to focus more on growing revenues elsewhere. And for a handful, either one or both could be an existential threat.

These companies are:

1. Oracle

Oracle, the fourth-largest software company in the world, has a huge customer base including more than 75% of the Fortune 500.

It has a global business of around $30bn, and it generates more than 40% of its revenue from customers located outside the US.

It also has significant investments in the US. But since Oracle CEO Safra Catz recently announced that she'll step down from her role in 2017, it looks like her company is already planning for the changes that could come to US-based companies based in the future.

The new rules will give companies like Oracle plenty of time to adjust to the new rules, before they are implemented on a large scale. So if they don't need to do anything, they'll be in a position to weather any economic storm that could be laid on it as a result of the new rules.

But in the past 18 months since the Trump election victory, Oracle shares have plunged almost 40%. At its peak in 2016, the S&P 500 was up almost 60%. So these financial changes have caused Oracle a realignment that might hurt the company over the long term.

In the meantime, Oracle will make decisions about its future and its strategy with the new rules that might not be good for the company to do. In the end, that could hurt Oracle a lot more than the regulatory change would hurt it.

2. Cisco Systems

This is a little harder to predict. Cisco controls more than 60% of the networking equipment business in the US. It makes devices that connect to the Internet, including switch-based networks, software as a service (SaaS) devices and routers.

Cisco also makes switches and routers that have to be installed in data centers. But while Cisco customers can only buy Cisco switches

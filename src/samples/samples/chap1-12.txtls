A game where you play the role of one of the heroes on this side, in hopes a miracle might happen. The other side is controlled by the bad guys, who have their own set of obstacles to face.

That's pretty normal for a homemade item. But why the double-speed pump? Some Eclairs are prepared in small batches, and need to be mixed. This allows them to keep their shape. The other problem is that the texture of the cookie isn't perfectly smooth and round (though some manufacturers make their own). Eclairs were so unpopular that they became a sort of collector's item.

"You're going to put your spoon in your mouth and you're going to get this gummy texture inside that is going to stick around," says Scott Hickey, Ph.D., an author and food expert, who worked for several years as an assistant professor of restaurant management at the Culinary Institute of America and has written books about food and cooking. But not really. When the spoon's smooth surface

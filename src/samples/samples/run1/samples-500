 trainers for the first time, while still managing to find the time to work one more hour than you wanted to.

There's a reason they do this, not because it's the only thing that makes them feel good, but because it's the only thing that gives them a chance to see it coming—and you can see it coming any time. Think of it like a light that needs to be switched on every time you pull into a garage sale or flea market or garage sales, right when the salespeople first come out. When that light goes on, a light goes off for the people that can handle it. Once it gets turned off, their enthusiasm and focus and enthusiasm and focus and energy are lost.

And that's why they stop going. If you can't turn on that light that needs to be turned on, then you can get out of here. That's why they stopped coming.

Once you see it coming, you're almost there.

That's what I want you to do. I want you to turn on that light that needs to be turned on. I want you to turn off that light that needs to be turned off. I want you to be the kind of person you're missing, and I want you to come back home.

When they can do these two things with me, they no longer need me. They no longer need to work two more hours, and they're no longer going to leave because they're afraid of what might happen if they don't.

What's the answer?

The answer is to figure out a way to turn on that key light in your own living space that needs to be turned on every day, and to turn that key off when it's off.

There are other ways to turn them on and to turn them off, but in this one, there are no limits. It won't change. You decide what to do, and it will change.

I'll bet money that you need to turn that light on and take that key out of your key chain when you read this book. I'll bet money you need to take that key and get those clothes off and set those books down when you read this book.

And I bet that those two things you're reading right now will help you. This is what will create the momentum, but you have to decide, do you accept what you're reading as truth or not? If you do, and you decide, do you accept it as your reality or not?

Now, as soon as you make that decision, it changes what you need to do. You can either let it go or you can decide to keep moving, and then you'll have to deal with what comes after. Once you do that with me, then I can either say: Okay, you can go, or I can make things difficult for you. That's how it becomes a matter of your choice.

You can either turn that light on and decide to keep pushing and creating, and then you can be with me. But if you choose to put yourself into that situation, then you have to deal with me.

Because if you decide when you decide to turn on that key that you won't put up with it anymore and that you will leave a different person, whether it's you or someone who comes after you, then you can't put this in a positive light.

Because what you're making is: I'm going to be with you or I'm not going to allow you in this living space anymore. Which you can tell the person who comes after; you don't have to reveal it to them.

It's not fair to do that, because you decide that, so you decide that doesn't matter whether I'm doing it or not, that if you don't allow me to be with you in that living space, it's okay. But that's not true. It does matter.

If you've made a decision, once you've made a decision, you can't take it back once you've made it; no matter what anyone says, you can't take it back once it's made.

Because it has been made. When you don't choose to continue in your own living space anymore, and the situation changes—or changes—just as fast as you can do it yourself, then all I have to do is say, okay, don't come back, let me know, and then it's no longer a living space, even if it may be your living space in your mind but it's not in the outside world—or inside the living room, even if it's a living room. You have to make that decision that says: No longer have me under your roof.

When you decide that, you can say, OK, it's over. It's done, and then it's your choice. You are no longer under the roof, but you may decide to stay on board. Which one

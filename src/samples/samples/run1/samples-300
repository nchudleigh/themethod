 of one of these devices is not to expect the rest of your organization to purchase one for use. Do not offer it to all your salespeople. The first time I heard any of these salespeople offer a free smartphone to a team member, I was taken aback. I've since learned that the devices often do have unique features—as you will see in the examples below.

How is the best strategy to get more prospects? Because it works. When you can:





• Get 100% of your call volume from a mobile device

• Get call volume from a mobile device (for every person with a device) that averages 30% higher than from your landline phones (for every person with a landline phone)

• Get call volume from mobile (for every person with a device) (which means more of everything)

• Get call volume from a mobile device (for every person) that averages 2.5 times higher than call volume from your landline phones

• Increase call volumes from a mobile device (for every person) that averages 10% higher than from your landline phones (for every person)

• Get call volume from every person (with a device) that averages 30% higher than from your landline phones (with you as the user)





Why do consumers say the right thing in conversations with prospects? Because it works. When you can:





• Ask questions that matter—not just about themselves but about their business, their prospects, their competition, their competitors, opportunities, and what matters to them

–• Develop trust and rapport with prospects and prospects' prospects, or for that matter with many prospects, to do what is expected of them

• Make prospects feel valuable to themselves and valuable to their business

• Recognize how value is created by other, similar, customers in that relationship

• Recognize that customers and prospects are actually not the same, and how that's important and how both are different from themselves

• Recognize that customers and prospects are not the same from a sales perspective, and how that's important—and how that's different from the way they're thinking—and how one has a different role and different responsibilities than the other





How do you get a 10% increase in calling from mobile? Well, it depends on what kind of mobile device a prospect has. You'll want to use a smartphone, if possible because you'll have more choices when it comes to apps that you can use with your app. For example, an iPhone 6 Plus or Samsung Galaxy S6 and up can be used with an app called Call Recorder from Square (in case you don't know what I mean) because it comes pre-installed. You can install the apps that will work for your device. This isn't a game-set, it's more for a demo, and the apps that work are what your prospect will try them.

You should also do a demo with an old phone if you have one that is no longer serviceable. I'll show you in a moment how.





Which Mobile Platforms will Make Up the Final 10% of Your Call Volume?

You can get some great metrics that will give you insight on how well you're doing. One great metric is the percentage of calls that come from certain mobile platforms. This way you can know the specific features you need to offer your prospects, and can evaluate if it's actually what their business needs. This also tells you how well you're doing in terms of sales and growth. The mobile platform is also the platform on which people tend to leave a final sales impression. Here is a typical snapshot.

Platform SDR Platform ROI Platform SDR ROI iPhone 11 percent 1.6 percent 10 percent Google Hangouts/Google+ 41 percent 35 percent 20 percent Android 44 percent 44 percent 28 percent

There are five things you want to know about that above screenshot.

1. Platform SDRs are 21 percent more likely to leave a final sale than a Platform ROI SDR. They are less likely to leave a final sales impression.

2. Platform SDRs are 13 percent more likely to leave a final sales impression than Platform ROI SDRs. This is largely because a Platform ROI SDR likely would leave a final sale impression if his or her phone didn't have a pre-installed app.

3. Platform SDRs are 6

======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================


Sitting here in the United Kingdom I thought I already knew all about how to win and lose deals online. After all I'm a business owner myself and I've also worked in the business world. I've worked in online retail, SEO marketing, sales and customer service.

That's where things begin to deviate, because all of a sudden I'm finding myself in the back of this long, long process of learning things myself. All the old "wisdom" that I grew up with doesn't make much sense these days.

So, here are my tips on how to lose a deal in 10 days:

Never give up, don't give in and try again

Never tell yourself that you've had it all your life and the next offer will be the same price

Take your time and do the research

Be persistent and be willing to try even on the first offer you get

Don't give in or give up

Always make sure your phone will still be on when the deal is done, because if you've been wasting your time before the transaction has started, it could just be the deal you didn't get


You might have heard that some online retailers will ask you to make a commitment first before the process starts, so if you're not committed the first time, they'll cancel the deal without giving you a refund. And some online retailers let you cancel a deal if there's a problem with your credit card and/or your payment method. But, if your offer still looks good, just ask for a refund or ask the retailer to switch to another retailer.

Never give up for the first offer

The first offer might be the best offer, but that doesn't mean it's always the most expensive. It's easy to get stuck between two deals at the last minute â€” you're looking to make a decision, get things done and get on with other things that have you wanting to move on to the next offers. That's when you find yourself at the bottom of a long thread of sales.

But if you can't find time to keep a close eye on all the offers on offer you'll be giving up. I've never met anyone who was happy to make a commitment that wasn't going to work when the clock counted down.

So, if your offer looks good at the time and you are getting emails about both deals, I would suggest just make the offer.

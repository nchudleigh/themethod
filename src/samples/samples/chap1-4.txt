Do you think there's a bias against singles?

People believe it's difficult to get married.

We hear you. So we're re-examining the statistics and testing out a new marriage research system here at the Marriage Planner, with a little help from our friends at Zillow, who have analyzed the Census Bureau's data to give you a great marriage budget. In this post, you'll find the 10 best cities for couples to tie the knot based on the median home price, median age, percentage of married couples and percent of the population that is married. It can also help you figure out how long it will take you to find a partner.

The cities with the highest median home values will cost you less, on average, to get married. You'll also need less time to actually get the right person.

And the cities with lowest costs will require a bit more time and money. You'll need more time, effort and perhaps even a bit of luck.

But there are other reasons why having a home makes your chances of getting married a little more likely.

In addition to our own research, below you'll find two important statistics from the Census Bureau that are key to understanding your marriage options, and what you need to make sure you are a good match.

Median home prices

The median home price of a city is an average of the sale prices of homes in all home types (homes, condos and townhomes).

According to the 2017 American Community Survey (ACS), in the 25 most populated metros, the median home value was $280,000.

What does a median value of a home have to do with your partner's future success or failure to find the right match?

If you are the lucky person who was able to find both a great place to live and the right partner, then you may have a greater chance of starting a family. But there is other way to evaluate if you would be a good candidate: how much did you spend on the things that make a home worth

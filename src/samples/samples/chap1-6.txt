A 'no deal' scenario for Brexit would result in Britain being able to rejoin the EU by making a simple request to negotiate a trade deal.

But once Britain made that request to negotiate the deal, all of the EU's regulations applied to the country.

What has to happen for a UK-UK trade deal to result in the UK leaving EU? Brexit would have to be triggered by the President of the European Council. However, this is only possible if the Prime Minister resigns or has to step down by the end of a European Council meeting. The President must then call an extraordinary Euroelections before this election is held. If the President doesn't call the Euroelection, he or she has to wait until the next one. An electoral vote must then be held to decide the winner of the Euroelections. In the end, the President must call a new Euroelections until the end of 2022, and if no leader is elected, the current President may be forced to resign.

The new trade deal - or an extension to an existing deal - would have to be implemented in the same way Britain had the EU deal, which means British people still had to apply for visas and meet the same restrictions on travel and goods that other EU citizens face.

And this is where Brexit becomes more complicated.

EU states would still have the right to restrict and control access Britain wished to receive in future - it was one of the areas on which talks broke down in January during prime minister Theresa May's visit to Brussels.

But this could only be done if Britain changed its laws - meaning Britain would have to implement Brexit in its entirety - something that experts say has little chance of happening.<|endoftext|>If you're looking for a place to live in Los Angeles — one where you can live on the beach and have brunch with the boys — you couldn't make it up.

 - why you need to be prepared!

The "How to Lose a Deal in 10 Days" article has gone over the top. But as a long time investor in stocks, I understand that losing your investment can be devastating.

If you are like me and you lose a deal or a position in a few days, it can really shake your confidence.

You might worry that you have missed an investment opportunity, and you might need to go back and reconsider whether to take on the current position or move up a position.

Here are 4 steps that can help you prepare properly for your next big stock loss.

STEP #1: Learn from the last one!

Remember the last time you lost a big position in stocks that ended up blowing up?

This will probably make you feel even more anxious about the current situation. Don't fall into the same trap.

When you have gotten comfortable taking profit, remember all the steps that you normally take in order to make money. Take a look at what happened to the previous investors you lost to.

They took time to learn from the mistake and avoid making it again.

The time it will take to learn from recent losses is time you are not using to make money.

STEP #2: Prepare yourself for the worst!

If you do make it through a really big loss, the worst case scenario might happen.

You might get stuck in a "buy wall" or an "out of money" situation or it might be a combination of all three. The point that I am getting at is that there is no guarantee you can make all of the profits needed to get out and avoid a big loss.

Make a plan and prepare for the worst.

You might need to sell out of your most recent position, close your current position to avoid further losses, invest some extra money now and then just in case, and do some extra work and study to get ready for the next big blowup.

It is not so much that you need more money to make it all back as it is that you need some extra brain power just in case.

Acknowledge your losses, get back on track when you can, and plan for your next big win.

You are likely going to lose some money on your next big win just like you have lost on your last big loss. That is normal. However, you should still get back on track.

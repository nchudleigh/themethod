[quote]A few years ago I interviewed a man for a position in a large and fairly high-profile law firm. Although my resume wasn't impressive, I interviewed well and seemed like a nice guy who got it. The hiring manager was extremely interested in me, but in order to get the job, she had to get past my boss [url=http://www.wallstreetoasis.com/quotes/what-to-talk-about-at-work-with-boss] 10-31-2012 [/url][/b]

[quote]There is a phrase I'm afraid of hearing: "I'm not impressed." I've been told it by so many that I'll have to call one of those people to get the true extent of what was said. On one level, it's true. On another level, it's a compliment. The word unimpressed applies to a person who is not as excited about something as he should be. The reason is simple and is found in the fact that not every person is born with enthusiasm. It's not inborn. It's learned. When you're excited, it is easy to forget about details you don't care about. You don't have to remember your grades or even the weather if you're not excited about it. It's the same thing with working. Not everyone has the natural aptitude necessary to excel in the job they seek. There are those, however, who are born with a spark of talent that can only be expressed through hard work, dedication, and relentless practice. When a person can focus his efforts on a task, put his mind to it, and master it, he will achieve much of what he sets out to do. This isn't to say that everyone can be like this, but it's not far-fetched to believe that it's more possible than you think. If nothing else, the next time someone tries to convince you of something and then talks too long, pause and think about how he's being so presumptuous about it. When you get to that point in an argument, it's time to take a step back and let the person have his or her say and decide for himself. [/quote]

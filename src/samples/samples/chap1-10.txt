: Why the secret meeting in a hotel lasted 15 hours


Secret meetings: The last-minute phone calls between the President and members of the German government were made in the hotel bar

The last-minute phone calls between the President and members of the German government were made in the hotel bar.


After the discussions, a final call went to the hotel's reception desk and the president then emerged to greet his guests on Saturday evening.


After he stepped out of the President's limo, the first lady greeted him and waved at the crowd waiting to greet him.

The President was accompanied on his trip by his wife, Angela Merkel, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany and Health Minister Manuel Valls.

President Obama had been due to fly to Berlin later Saturday night but the trip was delayed when a snowstorm hit the Midwest.


'I hope that we can now finally get back on track and make progress on the issues we were able to reach, on issues that are critical to making sure that this economy works for everybody, not just those at the very top,' he said later on Saturday after his two-day Berlin visit.


'I want to thank Chancellor Merkel for her leadership throughout this trip and for hosting me in the first place. I want to offer my sincere congratulations on this historic, historic visit. (It) may be my last visit here.'

Merkel had met the president in the Oval Office earlier this week, making their first appearance on the same stage at the White House.

After the meeting, the two spoke by telephone and the chancellor later made her first remarks at a joint news conference.

'President Obama asked for my help in continuing his important discussions with President Putin,' she said.

'I listened to him, and agreed. That is something I always do, I agree with the person that has to present the documents and discuss the issues.'

The German chancellor said she had never doubted the United States could remain a 'proud member of the international security community.'

'This is what we call our alliance, and it is what is good for both our countries, for our security, and the world at large,' she said.<|endoftext|>The second day of the 2012 NARMS event in San Diego, CA had a range of presentations from those who want to keep firearms legal under gun control to those

A lot has happened in the space of just 10 days. Here's our list of the top five events that have taken place since the end of February.

March 1. With The Economist being sold to an American investment company, the British publication was on high alert. So, on that very same night, the New Statesman's editor-in-chief, John Lloyd, declared that 'one thing is certain', and that 'the American right is now in control of the UK media'.

The site's founder and editor, Paul Dacre, announced the launch on the BBC in March 2016 in a speech titled "Brexit: a great leap for Britain." He said: "The referendum and subsequent campaign showed the world that it is possible to change your mind with the flick of a flick of a remote control. There are many different ways to vote this week but perhaps the most important vote of all is this week's election for the House of Commons."

News outlets such as Business Insider and Sky News reported on the site's launch. However, on

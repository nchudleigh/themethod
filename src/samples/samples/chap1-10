The biggest problem with contract negotiations is that it seems like they never end. Whether you're talking about salary, bonus, trade, or extension talks, these contracts aren't going to stick around forever. You're either going to make a final push to get a contract done and avoid the waiting game or you'll find yourself in another dead end deal before the deadline.

The ideal situation is to always go after the biggest contract at the end of the calendar year. You also should try to do as much as you can to get the player's current team off your back and have a good contract as well. For example, the Los Angeles Kings got a pretty good deal when they gave Matt Greene a two-year, $3 million deal last year. They had little use for Greene, who was a bottom-six forward and was never going to be a top-six man. It was good for them to see a player going to a contending team and being put on the right deal at the right time.

While it's not always the most likely scenario, I'll put my money on an extension being done in the first week of March. Players can still sign extensions while they're on the year-end lists, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a few big-ticket deals get done this year and next. It's probably going to go on until the offseason is officially over for the year.

I've seen contracts that will last 10, 15, even 25 years. That might seem like a long time, but there are so many variables that will have to be accounted for by the clubs and the player once the year is over. These contracts will be interesting to watch, but I'm thinking they are going to be at least one year longer than what could have been.<|endoftext|>I'll have to admit, I was a bit surprised after I received my package. I had ordered some stuff to give the new cat a plaything, and I was thrilled to receive so many kinds of toys for him to play with.

 of negotiations: Do it the way you were taught to do it, to win friends and influence people.

It's what Donald Trump and Stephen Friedman learned in their first three months working together in New York City, how the Republican campaign of 2015 began.

The two men, both from Brooklyn and born to wealth, met for a brief meeting and hit it off. They hit it off so well, there was nothing between the two men.

So then, they got together and they started negotiating, and they never said no to each other.

But when a deal was in fact struck -- it would lead to a partnership in an apartment building by Trump's Fifth Avenue headquarters, the Grand Hyatt Hotel, to buy a controlling interest in the building, and Friedman's hedge fund to buy a majority of the shares in the building -- Friedman would lose an astonishing 40 percent of his value within 10 days of getting close to the deal.

Trump's negotiating team did not ask Friedman for anything, but just wanted one more favor, an "informal" meeting with Friedman, one that got off to a chaotic start because Trump's staff said the man was no good and he was going to quit immediately afterward, according to Friedman.

On April 26, the Trump Organization's lawyers approached Friedman's firm, the Elliott Management Corp. and asked for $5 billion to be paid out on the deal, which would have had Friedman becoming the largest shareholder in Trump Tower.

On May 5, that amount was reached and Friedman agreed to the settlement, which the Trump Organization touted in its press release as the most important deal of his career.

A few days later, shortly before Friedman signed the preliminary agreement, Donald Trump held a news conference to announce the deal, a deal Friedman's team had done nothing to help negotiate. Trump also made sure the deal got noticed in the local press, which, as Friedman notes, is how you find out about deals you do not want people to learn about. "The media will go right along for the ride."

Within days, it was announced that Friedman's firm would receive a $3.4
